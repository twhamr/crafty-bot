# crafty-bot

Custom Discord Bot that uses a Python developed API integration for Crafty Controller.  
This is my first ***bigger*** Python project that I wanted to do after working with APIs at my internship.  
This is a passion project that I came up with to showcase my proficiency in Python programming and working with APIs, while also providing myself with a helpful tool when managing my minecraft servers on a local server machine.

### Notice
As of 07/27/2025:  
> This project is very much WIP and I will be adding more functionality for the Discord Bot until it accomplishes my needs. I am pausing work on the Discord Bot and pouring my effort into fully finishing integration for the Crafty Controller API. Will update when that gets finished!

## Functionality

There is alot of functionality that this Discord Bot provides:  
* listing all servers
* listing online servers

* sending commands to running servers

* much more to come...

The API integration for Crafty Controller contains all calls mentioned in the documentation.
